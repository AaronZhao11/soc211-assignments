    "1. What are your dependent variables? Why do they interest you?\n",
    "\n",
    "My dependet varialbe is people (the respondents of GSS, which are American citizens)'s confidence level in the American Education system. They interest me because I am very interested in the differences in attitudes between immigrants towards the United States in comparision to native born citizens. This would be a first step in determining that relationship, starting from participants' confidence level in education in relation to their educational level, with the immigration status being the control variable. \n",

    "2. What are your independent variables? What direction to you hypothesize will be the relationship between your dependent variable and your dependent variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "My independent variable is the educational level of the participants. I hypothesize that the higher the educational attainment of participants (from both immigrants and native born citizens) the higher their confidence in education wil be.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Why do you think your dependent variables are associated with your independent variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why I believe my dependent variable is associated with my independent variable is because having been educated, the respondents must have a positive view on education, even if not I assume people who are educated may poesses some form of pride for being educated, thus increasing their confidence in the educational system (thus at the same time validating themselves). \n",
    "\n",
    "4. What are your control variables? Do you think they will show any spurious, intervening, or interactive relationships? Why?]\n",
    "\n",
    "My control variable would be the participants'status as a citizen (weather or not they are immigrants or native born). This would be an intervening control variable because it will follow the independent variable (education attinment), preceding the dependent variable (confidence level in education) in this succession sequence."

    "There is a relationship between my dependent variable (confidence in educational system) and my independent variable (educational attainment). There is a strong relationship, but it is very interesting: people from the two extreme spectrums both have relatively high confidence in the educational system, with participants who are more educated having a higher confidence than the non-educated participants. The confidence in educational system is the lowest amongst people who have a little education, and it gradually increases as people become more and more educated. Adding the control did not reveal any spurious, intervening, or interactive relationship, or at least it did not appear to me that the control has revealed any relatinships. They do not entirely confrom with my hypotheses. My educated guess would be that people who have no educational experience has a higher confidence in the educational system because they have high hopes and expectations for this institution that they did not participate in. For people who are only a little educated, they may have dropped out of the educational system due to various reasons, resulting in a bad experience and confidence in the educational system. Those who are highly educated may poesses some form of pride for being educated, thus increasing their confidence in the educational system (thus at the same time validating themselves). To test this reason, I may have to obtain data through the implementation of survey questions I personally draft that specifically address this phenomenon. \n"
